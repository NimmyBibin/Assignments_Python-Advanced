    "In Python, both __getattr__ and __getattribute__ are used for attribute access in classes, but they have some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__(self, name) is called only when the attribute being accessed is not found by the usual methods like the instance's dictionary, the class hierarchy, or its properties. It is invoked after the attribute lookup has failed using the usual method. It is intended to provide a fallback for missing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__(self, name) is called for every attribute access, whether it exists or not. It is always invoked first, even if the attribute is already present in the instance's dictionary. Therefore, it can potentially hide or override other attributes, and it can be used to customize attribute access at a lower level."

They provide a simple way to control access to attributes without requiring users of the class to change their code.

They allow you to define the getter, setter, and deleter methods as separate classes that can be shared between different attributes in different classes.

    "Both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods in Python that are used to intercept attribute access. However, there is an important difference between the two methods.\n",

    "`__getattr__` is only called if the attribute being accessed is not found by the usual lookup process. It takes a single argument, the name of the attribute being accessed, and it must return the value of the attribute or raise an `AttributeError` exception if the attribute does not exist.\n",

They are defined by defining one or more of the `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods, which are called when the attribute is accessed, assigned to, or deleted.
