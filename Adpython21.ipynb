    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of observing different outcomes or events in a random process. In other words, it assigns a probability to each possible outcome of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider rolling a six-sided die. The probability distribution for this scenario assigns an equal probability of 1/6 to each of the possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the values of a probability distribution are random, the distribution itself is not. It represents a model of the underlying random process and allows us to make predictions about the likelihood of different outcomes. By using the probability distribution, we can calculate the probability of observing certain outcomes or events and make informed decisions based on those probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you know the probability distribution of the outcomes of a coin flip (50% heads, 50% tails), you can predict that if you flip a coin 100 times, you should expect to get approximately 50 heads and 50 tails. However, due to the randomness involved, the actual outcome may deviate from this prediction."

    "\n",
    "True random numbers are generated by physical processes that are inherently unpredictable, such as radioactive decay or atmospheric noise. These processes produce numbers that are truly random and cannot be predicted, even with complete knowledge of the system. True random numbers are often used in cryptography and other applications where high levels of randomness are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms that produce a sequence of numbers that appear to be random but are actually deterministic. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use a seed value as input to their algorithms, and from this seed, they produce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. However, if the seed value is known, the entire sequence can be reproduced, which means that the numbers are not truly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they can mimic the properties of true random numbers well enough for many practical purposes. PRNGs can produce sequences of numbers that have statistical properties similar to truly random numbers, which is often sufficient for simulations, modeling, and other applications that do not require high levels of cryptographic security."

The two main factors that influence the behavior of a normal probability distribution are its mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "The mean of a normal distribution is the center of the distribution and represents the average value of the data. It determines the location of the peak of the curve. If the mean is shifted to the right or left, the entire curve will shift accordingly. In other words, the mean affects the position of the distribution on the horizontal axis.\n",

    "The standard deviation of a normal distribution is a measure of the spread of the data. It determines how tightly the data is clustered around the mean. If the standard deviation is large, the distribution will be more spread out, and the curve will be flatter and wider. If the standard deviation is small, the distribution will be more concentrated around the mean, and the curve will be taller and narrower.\n",
