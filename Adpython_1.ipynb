    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to organize and structure code so that it is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows you to define custom types, called classes, that can have attributes and methods. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of the class. By encapsulating data and behavior within a class, you can create more intuitive and self-contained code that is easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OOP in Python can also lead to code that is more flexible and extensible. By defining abstract classes or interfaces, you can create a common interface for multiple related classes. This allows you to write code that can work with any object that implements that interface, rather than having to write separate code for each class.\n",
