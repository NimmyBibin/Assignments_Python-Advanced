    "There are several ways to increase the comparison between different figures on the same graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a consistent scale: Ensure that the scale for each axis is the same across all figures, as this allows for a direct visual comparison between them. This is especially important when comparing changes over time or different sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use color or shading: Use different colors or shading to distinguish between the different figures on the graph. This can help to highlight the differences between the data sets and make it easier for the viewer to interpret the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use labels and annotations: Adding clear and concise labels and annotations to the graph can help to draw attention to important features and differences between the data sets. This can include axis labels, figure titles, and annotations for specific data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a different graph type: Sometimes using a different type of graph can make it easier to compare different figures. For example, a stacked bar chart can be used to compare the total value of each category, while a grouped bar chart can be used to compare the values of each category within a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reduce clutter: Finally, it is important to avoid clutter on the graph, as this can make it difficult to compare different figures. This can include removing unnecessary gridlines, reducing the number of data points, and simplifying the graph design."

Over time, the interest earned on an initial investment grows exponentially as the interest from each period is added to the principal amount.

    "The three types of array multiplication between two NumPy arrays are dot product, outer product, and regular multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dot Product:\n",
    "The dot product of two NumPy arrays is a binary operation that takes two arrays of the same size and returns a scalar value. It is also known as inner product. The dot product is calculated by taking the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of the two arrays. For example, if `A` and `B` are two NumPy arrays of the same size, then the dot product of `A` and `B` is calculated as `np.dot(A, B)` or `A.dot(B)`. The dot product is useful in linear algebra and matrix calculations, such as solving systems of linear equations and computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Product:\n",
    "The outer product of two NumPy arrays is another binary operation that takes two arrays of different sizes and returns a new array of shape `(m, n)`, where `m` is the length of the first array and `n` is the length of the second array. The outer product is calculated by taking the product of each element in the first array with each element in the second array. For example, if `A` and `B` are two NumPy arrays, then the outer product of `A` and `B` is calculated as `np.outer(A, B)`. The outer product is useful in calculating covariances and correlations in statistics and in machine learning algorithms, such as kernel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regular Multiplication:\n",
    "The regular multiplication of two NumPy arrays is an element-wise multiplication. It takes two arrays of the same size and returns a new array of the same size. The regular multiplication is calculated by multiplying each element in the first array with the corresponding element in the second array. For example, if `A` and `B` are two NumPy arrays of the same size, then the regular multiplication of `A` and `B` is calculated as `A * B`. Regular multiplication is useful in computing element-wise operations such as Hadamard product, element-wise division, or taking the power of an array.\n",

If a string is shorter than the specified length, it is padded with null characters. This can lead to wasted memory if most of the strings in the array are shorter than the specified length.\n",

    "\n",
    "Slow performance: Compared to other data types, string data can be slower to process in NumPy arrays due to the overhead of working with variable-length data. In particular, operations like sorting and searching can be slower for strings than for numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited functionality: Some NumPy functions and operations may not work with string data or may produce unexpected results. For example, string concatenation using the + operator may not work as expected, and some mathematical operations like np.mean() and np.std() cannot be applied to string data."
