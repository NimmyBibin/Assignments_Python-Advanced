In other words, a subclass can be derived from two or more parent classes, and it will have the properties and methods of all its parent classes."

    "Delegation is often used to simplify code by breaking up complex objects into smaller, more manageable components. By delegating certain tasks to other objects, an object can focus on its core responsibilities and avoid becoming too complex and unwieldy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, delegation is typically implemented by defining a \"delegate\" object that is responsible for performing a specific task. The delegating object then passes on the task to the delegate object by invoking one of its methods. The delegate object then performs the task and returns the result to the delegating object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation can be used in a variety of contexts, including user interfaces, networking, and event handling. For example, in a user interface, a button may delegate the handling of a click event to another object that knows how to perform the appropriate action."

    "\n",
    "Composition is often used as an alternative to inheritance, as it allows for more flexible and modular code. Instead of creating complex hierarchies of classes, where each subclass inherits behavior from its parent class, objects can be composed of smaller, more focused objects that handle specific responsibilities.\n",

    "In composition, an object may have one or more \"component\" objects that it uses to perform specific tasks. For example, a car object may be composed of a steering wheel, an engine, a set of wheels, and other components that work together to create the car's behavior. Each component object may be designed to handle a specific responsibility, such as steering, accelerating, or braking.\n",

    "Composition can also be used to create more complex objects from simpler building blocks. For example, a drawing application may compose complex shapes from basic geometric objects like circles, rectangles, and triangles."

    "\n",
    "However, the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a form of name mangling that makes it less likely that other classes will accidentally access or modify the attribute. When a pseudoprivate attribute is defined in a class, its name is \"mangled\" by Python to include the name of the class in the attribute name, as well as an additional underscore. This makes it more difficult for other classes to accidentally access or modify the attribute, since they would need to know the exact name of the mangled attribute."
